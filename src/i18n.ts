This enables me to precisely assemble, cable, and diagnose physical network components, server hardware, and IoT devices at the hardware level. I am currently training to become a Cloud Engineer to combine this physical expertise with modern cloud infrastructure (Azure, Terraform, Docker). I am looking for an entry-level position as a Junior Cloud Engineer or IT System Administrator in the Hamburg area.",
